This project, titled 'Enhancing Tourism Management through Sales Prediction Models,' aims 
to optimize tourism management strategies using data collection and deep learning techniques. 
We utilize comprehensive data from Booking.com, focusing on metrics like tourist arrivals, 
hotel bookings, revenue, seasonal trends, weather, and economic indicators. Using deep 
learning models such as LSTM, GRU, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models, we capture complex 
patterns in time series data to make accurate predictions.

OBJECTIVES  
• Forecasting Tourist Arrivals: Developing accurate forecasts of tourist arrivals based on 
historical data, seasonal trends, and external factors such as events and economic 
conditions. 
• Optimizing Hotel Occupancy and Pricing Strategies: Using predictive models to 
optimize hotel occupancy rates and pricing strategies, ensuring maximum revenue 
generation while maintaining competitive pricing.
